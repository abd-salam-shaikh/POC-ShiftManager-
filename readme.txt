This is a POC with an intent to add workers to shifts for a particular job mainly targeting the healthcare industry where doctors (as job seekers) show their availability by assigning themselves to a particular shift and are enrolled as workers.

Deploy the shift manager project on apache tomcat and access using the following URL: 

localhost:8080/job_posting.do?id=JP01
